    "## Course Description\n",
    "It's now time to push forward and develop your Python chops even further. There are lots and lots of fantastic functions in Python and its library ecosystem. However, as a Data Scientist, you'll constantly need to write your own functions to solve problems that are dictated by your data. The art of function writing is what you'll learn in this first Python Data Science toolbox course. You'll come out of this course being able to write your very own custom functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments. You'll gain insight into scoping in Python and be able to write lambda functions and handle errors in your very own function writing practice. On top of this, you'll wrap up each Chapter by diving into using your acquired skills to write functions that analyze twitter DataFrames and are generalizable to broader Data Science contexts."

    "In this exercise, you will define a function with the functionality you developed in the previous exercise, return the resulting dictionary from within the function, and call the function with the appropriate arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your convenience, the pandas package has been imported as pd and the 'tweets.csv' file has been imported into the tweets_df variable.\n",

    "* Define the function count_entries(), which has two parameters. The first parameter is df for the DataFrame and the second is col_name for the column name.\n",
    "* Complete the bodies of the if-else statements in the for loop: if the key is in the dictionary langs_count, add 1 to its current value, else add the key to langs_count and set its value to 1. Use the loop variable entry in your code.\n",
    "* Return the langs_count dictionary from inside the count_entries() function.\n",
    "* Call the count_entries() function by passing to it tweets_df and the name of the column, 'lang'. Assign the result of the call to the variable result.\n"
